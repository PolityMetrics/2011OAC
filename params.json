{"name":"The 2011 Area Classification for Output Areas","tagline":"2011 OAC","body":"The 2011 OAC has been created through collaboration between the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and University College London (UCL). The 2011 OAC is a three-tiered hierarchical geodemographic classification of the UK built using only 2011 UK Census data at the Output Area / Small Area level. It consists of 8 Supergroups, 26 Groups and 76 Subgroups. \r\n\r\nA number of 2011 OAC resources are available on the [ONS webpage](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/area-classifications/ns-area-classifications/ns-2011-area-classifications/index.html) and [Open Geodemographics](http://http://www.opengeodemographics.com/)\r\n\r\nThis webpage is designed to provide additional material and information to aid use of the 2011 OAC.

The lower the number, the higher the similarity that Output Area or Small Area has to the characteristics described in the Pen Portraits. \r\n\r\n**** Please note these maps should not be interpreted as having a higher level of precision than a standard choropleth map of Output Areas and Small Areas. The colour of an individual building is derived from the average of the Output Area or Small Area it is located in, and is not a reflection of that particular property itself. \r\n\r\n### Descriptions and Cluster Profiles\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Hierarchical Structure: [Download PDF] (http://bit.ly/OAC-Structure)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Pen Portraits: [Download ONS PDF] (http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/geography/products/area-classifications/ns-area-classifications/ns-2011-area-classifications/pen-portraits-and-radial-plots/pen-portraits.pdf)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Cluster Profiles - Radial Plots: [Download PDF] (http://bit.ly/OAC-Radial-Plots)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Cluster Profiles - Bar Plots: [Download PDF] (http://bit.ly/OAC-Bar-Plots)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Cluster Profiles - Plot Data: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/OAC-Plot-Data)\r\n\r\n### Input Data\r\n\r\n2011 OAC 167 Initial Variables Dataset: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/1o6pKrr)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC 60 Final Variables Dataset: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/1jTGQc5)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Variable Descriptions: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/WxXMuh)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Variable Names: [Download PDF] (http://bit.ly/1qyyM3J)\r\n\r\n2011 UK Output Areas and Small Areas Codes and Total Population lookup: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/OA-Pop-Lookup)\r\n\r\n### Cluster Evaluation \r\n\r\n2011 OAC Variable Correlation: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/1p7gzmV)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Cluster Evaluation: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/OAC-Evaluation)\r\n(Lorenz Curves, Gini Coefficients and Distribution Plots)\r\n\r\n### Colour Scheme\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Colour Scheme: [Download ZIP File]\t(http://bit.ly/OAC-Colours)\r\n\r\n2011 OAC ArcGIS Style: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/OAC-Style)\r\n\r\n### Logo\r\n\r\n2011 OAC Logo: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/OAC-Logo)\r\n\r\n### Batch Download\r\n\r\nDOWNLOAD ALL DATA: [Download ZIP File] (http://bit.ly/1nRyQUf)\r\n","google":"UA-52969603-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
